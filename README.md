# Alien Swarm AutoRecord

This tool will allow you to setup an automatic recording of your games in a few clicks!

Download and Extract the files, then Run AutoRecordInstaller.exe (or .ahk if you have AutoHotkey installed).
You will be asked the game executable localization.
The tool will then update newmapsettings.cfg and create AlienSwarmLauncher.bat
You will be asked to change your launch options
And it's done!
Now your games will be named "asrd_(date/time when u launched the game)_X.dem"
You can sort them by using my other tool : [DemoRenamer]()
